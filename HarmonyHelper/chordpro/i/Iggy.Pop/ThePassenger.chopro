{t:The passenger}
{st:by Iggy Pop}

{c:Intro: Am - F - C - G (and repeat and repeat...)}

[Am]I am the [F]passen[C]ge[G]r and I ride and I ride,
I ride through the city's backsides
I see the stars come out of the sky,
yeah the bright and hollow sky
you know it looks so good tonight

I am the passenger, I stay under glass,
I look through my window so bright 
I see the stars come out tonight
I see the bright and hollow sky
over the city's ripped backside
and everything looks good tonight.

{c:Chorus}
Singing la la la la la la la la... (3x)
La la

Get into the car, we'll be the passenger,
we'll ride through the city tonight,
we'll see the city's ripped backsides,
we'll see the bright and hollow sky
we'll see the stars that shine
so bright stars made for us tonight

O the passenger, how how he rides
O the passenger, he rides and he rides
He looks through his window, what does he see ?
He sees the sign and hollow sky
He sees the stars come out tonight 
He sees the city's ripped backsides
He sees the winding ocean drive
and everything was made for you and me
all of it was made for you and me 'cause it
just belongs to you and me
so let's take a ride and see what's mine... 

{c:Chorus}

O the passenger, he rides and he rides
he sees things from under glass
he looks through his window side
he sees the things he knows are his
he sees the bright and hollow sky
he sees the city sleep at night
he sees the stars are out tonight
and all of it is yours and mine
and all of it is yours and mine
so let's ride and ride and ride and ride...

{c:Chorus}
