[F]Hey I'm feeling so [Am]dirty, you're looking so [G]clean
[F]All you can give me is a [Am]spin in your washing [G]machine
[F]I fly off to Rome to my [Dm]prima bella
[F]She leaves me in the rain with a [Dm]telescopic umbrella

[C]Ooh the pain [C]  [G]  [F] -- [C]Modern love can be a strain  [C]  [G]  [Bb]  [F]

I trusted my venus was untouched in her shell
But the pearls in her system were as tacky as hell
For Lady Godiva I came incognito
But her driver had stolen her red hot magneto

{c: Chorus}
{c: Bridge:}
[A]   [E]
[E]I don't know why they leave me in the [C#m]lurch
To carry on the [C]search
It's driving me [D]up the wall
[E]When I have so much [C#m]passion
Romance is out of [C]fashion
I can't handle [D]Modern love at all

{c: Intro, twice}

So I worship Diana by the light of the moon
When I pull out my pipe she screams out of tune
In Paris my heart sinks when I see the Mona Lisa
She gives me the wink, then shows me the freezer

{c: Chorus, twice}
