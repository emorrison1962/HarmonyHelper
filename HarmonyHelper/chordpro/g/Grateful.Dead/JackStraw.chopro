[E]We can share the [F#m]women, we can share the [C#m]wine  
[E]We can share what [Bm]we've got of yours '[D]cause we [A]done shared all of [E]mine[G#m].  [D] 
[E]Keep on rollin', [F#m]just a mile to [C#m]go,  
[E]Keep on rollin', [Bm]my old [D]buddy, you're [A]movin' much too [E]slow[B].  [A] [E] [E]
[Esus7]I just jumped the [E7]watchman, [Esus7]right outside the [E7]fence,
[Esus7]Took his rings, four [E7]bucks in change, [Esus7]ain't that heaven [E7]sent?
[F#sus7]Hurts my ears to [F#7]listen, Shannon, [F#sus7]burns my eyes to [F#7]see,
[F#sus7]Cut down a man in [F#7]cold blood, Shannon, [F#sus7]might as well been [D]me. [Bm] [A] 
[D]We used to [Bm]play for [A]silver, now we play for [E]life;
[D]And one's for [Bm]sport and one's for [A]blood at the point of a [E]knife.
[D]And now the [Bm]die is [A]shaken, now the die must [E]fall;
[D]There ain't no [Bm]winner in [A]the game, [E]he don't go home with [A]all,
Not with [D]all[G].  [D] [G] [E] [Esus4] [E] [Esus4] 
 
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July,
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky.
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Santa Fe,
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne from sea to shining sea.

Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride,
Got to settle one old score, one small point of pride.
Ain't no place a man can hide, Shannon, to keep him from the sun;
Ain't no bed can give us rest, now, you keep us on the run.

Jack Straw from Witchita cut his buddy down,
And dug for him a shallow grave and laid his body down.
Half a mile from Tuscon, by the morning light,
One man gone and another to go, my old buddy you're moving much too slow.

We can share the women, we can share the wine.
