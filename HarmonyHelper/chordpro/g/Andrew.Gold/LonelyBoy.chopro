[A/C#]    [D]    [E/G#]    [A]
He was born on a summerday nineteen-fifty-one
And with the slap of a hand he had landed as an only son
His mother and father said what a lovely boy
W'll teach him what we've learned, oh yes, just what we've learned
We'll dress him up warmly and we'll send him to school
It'll teach him how to fight to be nobody's fool

{c:chorus}

[D]Oh, [G#m7-5]oh what a [C#m7]lonely [F#m7-5/C]boy
[B7sus4]Oh what a [B7]lonely [D]boy
[E7]Oh what a lonely b[A]oy
{eoc}

{c:piano}

In the summer of fifty-three his mother brought him a sister
And she told him: "We must attend to her needs, she's so much younger than you"
Well, he ran down the hall and he cried
Oh, how could his parents have lied
When they said he was their only son
He thought he was their only one

{c:chorus}
  
{c:solo: - bridge}
{c:then guitar}
Goodbye mama, goodbye youth
Goodbye papa, I'm pushing on through, ohoh
{c:piano (slow), theb +bas, +guitar, back to intro}

He left home on a winterday nineteen-sixty-nine
And he hoped to find all the love he had lost in that earlier time
Well, his sister grew up and she married a man
He gave her a son, oh yes, a lovely son
They dressed him up warmly, they sent him to school
They taught him how to fight to be nobody's fool
  
{c:chorus}
- Ohoh -
