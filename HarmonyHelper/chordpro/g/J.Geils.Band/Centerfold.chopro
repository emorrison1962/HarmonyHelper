{eot}
[G]Does she w[F]alk, does she t[C]alk, does she come[F] com[C]plete
My [G]home-brew, home-room [F]angel, just [C]pulled me to my [F]feet[C]
[G]She was pure like [F]snowflakes, no [C]one could ever [F]stain[C]
The [G]memory of my [F]angel could [C]never cause me [F]pain[C]
The [Em]years go by I'm looking thru a [Am]girly maga[C]zine[D]
And [Em]there's my homegrown angel on the [Am]pages in bet[C]ween[D]

{c:Chorus}
My [G]blood runs cold[F], my [C]memory has [F]just been [C]sold
My [G]angel is tha [F]centrefold [C](angel is the [F]centrefold[C])
My [G]blood runs cold[F], my [C]memory has [F]just been [C]sold
   [G]      [F]      [C](angel is the [F]centrefold[C])

Slip me a note under the desk loud and speaking about her dress
I was shy she turned away before she caught my eye
I was shakin' in my shoes whenever she flashed those baby blues
Something had a hold on me when angel passe close by
Those soft jersey sweaters too magical to touch
To see her in that langerie is really just too much

{c:Chorus}

Na na ....

It's OK I understand this ain't no never never land
I hope that whn this issue's gone I see you when your clothes are on
Take your car yes we will We'll take your car and drive
Take it to a hotel room and take 'em off in private
A part of me has just been ripped Angels from my mind are stripped
Oh no I can't hide it Oh yes I guess I gotta buy it

{c:Chorus}

Na na .....
