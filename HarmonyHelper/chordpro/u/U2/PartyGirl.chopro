There are only 3 chords in this song: Bmsus, Em, and A.
I'm not exactly sure of the name of the Bmsus chord.  These
chords repeat throughout the song.  The strumming pattern
is left as a exercise for the reader.

[Bmsus]     [Em]     [A]

I know a girl, a girl called Party, Party Girl
I know she wants more than a party, Party Girl
And she won't tell me her name
Oh no, not me

I know a boy, a boy called Brash, Brash Ham
I know he does all that he can
Wham bam
And she won't tell me his name
Oh no, not me

When I was young, I thought the world revolved around me
I was wrong
And so I sing along
And if you dance then dance with me

I know a girl, a girl called Party, Party Girl
I know she wants more than a party, Party Girl
I know a boy, a boy called Trampoline
You know what I mean
I think I know what he wants
I think I know what he wants
I think I know what she wants
I think I know what she wants
I think I know what he wants
I think I know what he wants


Well, thank you!
