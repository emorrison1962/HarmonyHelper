#Traditional, arranged by The Dubliners

I'll t[G]ell me ma when I get home, the b[D7]oys won't leave the g[G]irls alone,
P[G]ulled me hair, stole me comb but th[D7]at's allright till [G]I go home.
Sh[G]e is handsome, s[C]he is pretty s[G]he is the Belle of D[D7]ublin city,
Sh[G]e is a courtin' a [C]one two three, Pr[G]ay can you t[D7]ell me wh[G]o is she?

Albert Mooney says he loves her, all the boys are fightin' for her,
Knock at the door, ring at the bell, and "Oh, me true love, are you well?"
Out she comes, white as snow, rings on her fingers, bells on her toes
Ould Johny Morrissey says she'll  die,
                          if she doesn't get a fella with the roving eye.

Let the wind and the rain and the hail blow high,
                          and the snow comes a travelin' through the sky,
She's as sweet as an apple pie, she'll get her own lad by and by,
When she gets a lad of her own, she won't tell her ma when she gets home.
Let them all come as they will, It's Albert Mooney she loves still.
