I feel the pain of everyone
And then I feel nothing
I feel the pain of everyone
And then I feel nothing

{c: Riff}

[Dm]Is it up to [G]me
[Em]You won't [C]wait to see  [A]
[G]Screwed us yet [Em]again
[G]About as close as you [C]get  [A]

{c: Back to half tempo and intro chord pattern}

I feel the pain of everyone
And then I feel nothing
I feel the pain of everyone
And then I feel nothing

{c: Double time with riff}

Is it up to me
You won't wait to see
Screwed us yet again
About as close as you been
Hey now take it back
Get off the attack
Trailing on your scene
Just tryin' to keep it clean
