[G]We all came down to Montreux
on the Lake Ge[F]neva [G]shoreline
[G]To make records with the mobile
We didn't [F]have much [G]time
[G]Frank Zappa and the mothers
were at the best [F]place a[G]round
[G]But some stupid with a flare-gun
burned the place [F]to the [G]ground

[C]Smoke on the [Ab]water
[G]a fire in the sky
[C]Smoke on the [Ab]water

They burned down the gambling house
it died with an awful sound
A funky claude was running in and out
pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
we had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
it seemed that we would lose the race

Smoke on the water
a fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
it was empty cold and bare
But with the rolling truck stones thing outside
making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
we made a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know well never forget

Smoke on the water
a fire in the sky
Smoke on the water
