{t:Light my fire}
{st:The Doors}

You [Dm7]know that it would be un[Bm7]true
you [Dm7]know that I would be a [Bm7]liar
[Dm7]if I was to say to [Bm7]you
[Dm7]girl, we couldn't get much [Bm7]higher

[C]Come on baby [D]light my [G]fire [Em]
[C]come on baby [D]light my [G]fire [Em]
[C]try to set the [G]night on [A] fire

The time to hesitate is through
no time to wallow in the mire
try now we can only loose
And our love become a funeral pyre

{c: chorus}
