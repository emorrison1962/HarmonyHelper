[E][B][A]
[E]Here I am again in this [B]mean old town and your so far [E]away from me
Now where are you when the [B]sun gos down and your so far [E]away from me
[A]So far a[C#m]way from me,[B] so far I [E]just can't see
[A]So far a[C#m]way from me,[B] just so [A]far from [E]me[B][A][E]

I'm tired of bein in love and bein all alone when your so far away from me
I'm tired of makin out on the telephone cus your so far away from me
So far away from me, so far I just can't see
So far away from me, just so far from me

And I get so tired when I have to explain your so far away from me
See you be in the sun and I be in the rain and your so far away from me
So far away from me, so far I just can't see
So far away from me, just so far from me
