Three bodied lying there does Patty see
and another man named Bello moving mysteriously
"I didn't do it" he says, and he throws up his hands
"I was only robbin the register, I hope you understand
I saw them leavin," he says and he stops
One of us had better call the cops
so Patty calls the cops
and they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin
in the hot New Jersey night

Meanwhile somewhere in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around
number one contender for the middleweight crown
had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
when a cop pulled him over on the side of the road
just like the time before and the time before that
in Paterson that just the ways things go
If you black you might as well not show up on the streets 
Less you wanna draw the heat

Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin around
He said "I saw two men runnin out, they looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car with out of state plates"
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said "Wait a minute boys, this one's not dead"
so they took him to the infirmary
and although this man could hardly see
they told him that he could identify the guilty men

Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in
Take him to the hospital and bring him upstairs
the wounded man looks up though his one dying eye
says "why'd you bring him here for? he ain't the guy!"
Yes, here the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame 
for something that he never done
put in a prison cell but one time he could've been
the champion of the world

Four months later the ghetto's in flame
Rubin's in South America fightin for his name
while Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
and the cops are puttin the screw to him looking for somebody to blame
"Remember that murder that happened in a bar?"
"Remember you said you saw the getaway car?"
"You think you'd like to play ball with the law?"
"Think it might have been that fighter that you saw running that night?"
"Don't forget that you are white"

Arthur Dexter Bradley said "I'm really not sure"
Cops said "A poor boy like you could really use a break
We got you for the motel job and were talking to your friend Bello
Now you don't want to ave to go back to jail, be a nice fellow
You'll be doin' society a favor 
That son of a bitch is brave and getting braver
We want to put his ass in the stir
We want to pin this trip murder on him
He ain't ne Gentleman Jim"

Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
he never did like to talk about it all that much
It's my work he'd say, I do it for pay
and when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way
up to some paradise
where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
and ride a horse along a trail
but then they took him to the jail house 
where they try to make a man into a mouse

All of Rubin's card were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
the judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums
to the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum
but to the black folks he was a crazy nigger
no one doubted that he pulled the trigger
and though they could not produce the gun
the D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed

Rubin Carter was falsely tried
the crime was murder "one", guess who testified?
Bello and Bradley and the both badly lied
and the newspapers all went along for the ride
how can the life of such a man 
be in the palm of some fool's hand?
to see him obviously framed
couldn't help but be ashamed to live in a land
where justice is a game

Now all the criminal in their coats and their ties
are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
while Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten foot cell
and innocent man in a living hell
that's the story of the Hurricane
but it won't be over till they clear him name
and give him back the time he's done
put in a prison cell but one time he could've been
the champion of the world.
