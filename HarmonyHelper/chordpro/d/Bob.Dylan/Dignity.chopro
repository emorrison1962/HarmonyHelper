                [D]Fat man lookin' in a blade of steel
                Thin man lookin' at his last meal
                [G]Hollow man lookin' in a cottonfi[D]eld
                For dig-ni-ty   [G]   [D]  

                [D]Wise man lookin' in a blade of grass
                young man lookin' in the shadows that pass
                [G]poor man lookin' through painted [D]glass
                For dignity [G]   [D] 

                        [A]Somebody got murdered on New Year's Eve
                        [G]Somebody said dignity was the [D]first to leave
                        [G]I went into the city, [F#m]went into the town
                        [Em]went into the land of the midnight sun       [A] 

                [D]Searchin' high, searchin' low
                Searchin' everywhere I know
                [G]Askin' the cops wherever I go
                Have you seen Dignity?   [G]   [D] 

                Blind man breakin' out of a trance
                Puts both his hands in the pocket of chance
                Hopin' to find one circumstance
                Of dignity

                I went to the wedding of Mary-lou
                She said " I don't want nobody see me talkin' to you"
                Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew
                About dignity

                        I went down where the vultures feed
                        I would've gone deeper, but there wasn't any need
                        Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
                        Wasn't any difference to me

                Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade
                House on fire, debts unpaid
                Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid
                Have you seen dignity

                Drinkin' man listens to the voice he hears
                In a crowded room full of covered up mirrors
                Lookin' into the lost forgotten years
                For Dignity

                Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues
                Said he'd give me information if his name wasn't used
                He wanted money up front, said he was abused
                By dignity
                        
                        Footprints runnin' cross the silver sand
                        Steps goin' down into tatoo land
                        I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
                        In the bordertowns of despair

                Got no place to fade, got no coat
                I'm on the rollin' river in a jerkin' boat
                Tryin' to read a note somebody wrote
                About dignity

                Sick man lookin' for the doctor's cure
                Lookin' at his hands for the lines that were
                And into every masterpiece of literature
                For dignity

                Englishman stranded in the blackheart wind
                Combin' his hair back, his future looks thin
                Bites the bullet and he looks within
                For dignity

                        Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed
                        Dignity never been photographed
                        I went into the red, went into the black
                        Into the valley of dry bone dreams

                So many roads, So much at stake
                So many dead ends, I'm at the edge of the lake
                Sometimes I wonder what it's gonna take
                To find dignity
