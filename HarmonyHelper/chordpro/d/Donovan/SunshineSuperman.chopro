[C7]Sunshine came softly through my a-window today
[C7]Could've tripped out easy a-but I've a-changed my ways
[F]It'll take time I know it but in a while
[C7]You're gonna be mine I know it, we'll do it in style
[G7]'Cause I made my mind up you're [F]going to be mine, [F]I'll tell you right now
[C7]Any trick in the book now baby a-that I can find

Everybody's hustlin' just to have a little scene
When I say we'll be cool I think that you know what I mean
We stood on the beach at sunset, do you remember when?
I know a beach where baby a-it never ends
When you've made your mind up, forever to be mine
I'll pick up your hand and slowly blow your little mind

'Cause I made my mind up, you're going to be mine.
I'll tell you right now
Any trick in the book now baby a-that I can find.

Superman or Green Lantern ain't got a-nothin' on me
I can make like a turtle and dive for pearls in the sea
A-you-you-you can just sit there a-thinkin' on your velvet throne
'Bout all the rainbows a-you can a-have for your own
When you've made your mind up forever to be mine

I'll pick up your hand and slowly blow your little mind
When you've made your mind up, forever to be mine.
I'll pick up your hand and slowly blow your little mind
When you've made your mind up, forever to be mine.
