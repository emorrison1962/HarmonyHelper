66855  CHORD3.5.ZIP	It's purpose is to provide guitar players with a tool
			to produce good looking, self-descriptive music sheet
			from a text file. CHORD reads a text file containing 
			the lyrics of a song, the chords to be played, their 
			description and some other optional data to produce 
			a fancy PostScript document.

116913	CHORD3.6.tar.Z	The latest version of CHORD. See description above.
			Contains a .crd -> .chopro conversion program!

122044	DOSCHORD.EXE	This is a compiled binary DOS version of CHORD v3.5.

70170	CHORD3.6.EXE	Another compiled DOS version of CHORD version 3.6.

89088	CHORD.NT.EXE	CHORD version 3.6 compiled for Windows NT.

27520 MikeChord.sit.bin MikeChord is a HyperCard stack for the Mac that formats 
			ChordPro text for neatly-formatted output of guitar music
			to non-PostScript or PostScript printers or to a file.
			The output isn't elegant, but it works, and the program 
			also does the reverse (text w/ chords above lyrics --> ChordPro),
			and it will also play the song on the Mac's speaker.
			It supports all major Chord directives except {new_song}, 
			but doesn't have any of the fancy pagination and numbering 
			features, nor does it do transposition (yet).
			Requirements: Hypercard 2.0 or later, System 6.0.5 or later.

29197  chord_magic.zip	Chord Magic is a program that lets you easily experiment with 
			guitar chords.  Position your "fingers" anywhere on the 
			"fingerboard", and Chord Magic will tell you what chord 
			you're playing.  It recognizes chords by theory, not by shape,
			so it isn't limited in scope like some other chord programs.

82045 autotab-1.2a.tar.Z Autotab is a user-friendly song retrieval utility. It allows 
			rapid interactive searching of the Nevada archive (choosing 
			the mirror sites with the best response times automatically)
			and will get the song for you automatically and file it away 
			for you while you can be doing something else.

 9381  getit-2.tar.Z	A very useful ftp-utility to get files through anonymous
			ftp.


11369 C-ChordConvert.shar
			A shar-archive containing C-code for a CRD -> ChordPro 
			converter.
