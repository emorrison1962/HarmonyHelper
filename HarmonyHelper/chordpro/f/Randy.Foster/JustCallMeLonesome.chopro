{t:Just Call Me Lonesome}
{st:Randy Foster}

Just call me lo[A]nesome, heartbroke and th[E]en some
Cause I ain't got [B7]no one, since youv'e been [E]gone
You called me b[A]aby, now I've got a new [E]name
Don't need my ol[B7]d one, call me lonesome from now o[E]n
You used to c[B7]all me, your one and on[E]ly
But now you [A]only call me som[B7]eone you once knew
You were my angel, before some str[E]anger
Stole your he[A]art and stole my wo[B7]rld when he stole [E]you

{c:CHORUS:}
I see you with [B7]him, and fall apar[E]t again
Remembering wh[A]en I was the o[B7]nly man you needed
We said forever, we'd be tog[E]ether
He came bet[A]ween us and now fore[B7]ver lies in pie[E]ces

{c:CHORUS}
I don't need my [B7]old one, call me lonesome from now [E]on
