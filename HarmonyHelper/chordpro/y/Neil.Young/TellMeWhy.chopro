[C]Sailing heartships through [D]broken harbours
[Am7]Out on the [C]waves in the [G]night  [C][G]        [C]
[C]Still the searcher must [D]ride the dark horse
[Am7]Racing a[C]long in his [G]stride

{c:Chorus}
[D]Tell me [Am7]why  [C]   [G]  [C]  [G]  [D]
Tell me [Am7]why   [C]    [G]
Is it [Bm]hard to make arrangements with your[C]self
When you're [D]old enough to re[C]pay but [Bm7]young enough to [Em]sell
[C] [D] [Am7] [C] [G] 

[C]Tell me lies later [D]come and see me
[Am7]I'll be a[C]round for a [G]while   [C][G]        [C]
[C]I am lonely but [D]you can free me
[Am7]All in the [C]way that you [G]smile

{c:Chorus}
