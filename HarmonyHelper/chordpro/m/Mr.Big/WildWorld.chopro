Lalalalala la la la ...
[Dm]Now that I've [G]lost everything to [C]you
You say you [F]wanna start something [Bb]new
It's [Gm]breaking my heart you're [A]leaving, baby I'm breathing 
[Dm]If you wanna [G]leave take good [C]care
Hope you have a [F]lot of nice things to [Bb]wear
But then a [Gm]lot of nice things turn [A]bad out [C]there

{soc}
[F]Oh, [C]baby baby it's a [Bb]wild world
[C]It's hard to get [Bb]by just upon a [F]smile
[F]Oh, [C]baby baby it's a [Bb]wild world
[C]And I'll always re[Bb]member you , like a [F]child girl [Gm]
{eoc}

[Dm]You know I've seen a [G]lot of what the world can [C]do
And it's [F]breaking my heart in [Bb]two
Cause I [Gm]never wanna see you [A]sad girl, don't be a bad girl
[Dm]But if you wanna [G]leave take good [C]care
Hope you make a [F]lot of nice friends out [Bb]there 
Just re[Gm]member there's a lot of [A]bad every[C]where

{c:CHORUS}

[A]Baby I love you
[Dm]But if you wanna [G]leave take good [C]care
Hope you make a [F]lot of nice friends out [Bb]there 
Just re[Gm]member there's a lot of [A]bad every[C]where

{c:CHORUS}
