You know I love you
You know it's true
Give you all my love babe
What, can I do

{c:Chorus}
I'm walking, by my self
I hope you understand
I just want to be your lovin' man

{ci:1:st vers}

{ci:Chorus}
I'm walking, by my self
I hope you understand
I just want to be your lovin'
I just want to be your lovin'
I just want to be your lovin' man
