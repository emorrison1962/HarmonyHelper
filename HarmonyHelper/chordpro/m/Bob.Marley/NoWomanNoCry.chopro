  Said I remember when we used to sit
  In the government yard in Trenchtown.
  And then Georgie would make a firelight
  As it was love would burn in through the night.
  Then we  would cook cornmeal porridge
  of which I'll share with you.

  So, I've got to push on through, but while I'm gone
  [C]Ev'ry thing's gonna [G/B]be alright.  [Am]Ev'ry thing's gonna [Fm]be al[G]right.
  [C]Ev'ry thing's gonna [G/B]be alright.  [Am]Ev'ry thing's gonna [Fm]be al[G]right.

  No woman, no cry...No woman, no cry.
  Here Little sister, don't shed no tears, No woman, no cry.
