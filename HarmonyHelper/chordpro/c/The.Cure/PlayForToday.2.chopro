{eot}

It[Bm]'s not a c[A]ase of doing what's r[Bm]ight
It's just the w[A]ay I feel that ma[Bm]tters
Tell me I'm wr[A]ong, I don't really c[G]are

It's not a case of share and share alike
I take what I require
I don't understand... you say it's not fair

Yo[C#m]u expect me to a[D]ct like a lover
Co[C#m]nsider my moves and de[D]serve the reward
To[C#m] hold you i[D]n my arms
And w[C#m]ait... and wa[Cmaj7]it for something to happen    [Bm][A][Bm]

It's not a case of telling the truth
Some lines just fit the situation
You call me a liar, you would anyway

It's not a case of aiming to please
You know you're always crying
It's just your part in the play for today
