[Bm]     Don't say what you [C#m]mean you might spoil your [F#m]face
	   	If you walk in a [A]crowd you won't leave any [D]trace
	   	It's always the [C#m]same
	   	You're jumping someone else's train (intro tab)

[Bm]	 It won't take you [C#m]long to learn the new [F#m]smile
		You have to [A]adjust or you'll be out of [D]style
		It's always the [C#m]same
		You're jumping someone [F#m]else'[A]s [D]train

[Bm]	 It's the latest [C#m]wave that you've been craving [F#m]for
		The old [A]idea is getting such a [D]bore
		Now you're [C#m]back in line
		Goin' [Bm]not quite as far but in [A]half the time
		[G#m]Everyone's happy
		That they're [F#m]finally all the [E]same
		'cause everyone is jumping everybody [F#m]else'[A]s [D]train
