There's [Bm]no-one left in the w[D]orld that I can hol[G]d onto[D]
There is really no-one left at all, there is only you
And if you leave me now, you leave all that we were undone
There is really no-one left, you are the only one

And sti[F#m]ll the hardest p[G]art for you to put [D]your trust in me[Bm]
I love [F#m]you more than I [G]can say. Why won't [D]you just believe?[A]
