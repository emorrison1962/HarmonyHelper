[B]Intro  [A]        [B]         [A]         [B]          [A]         [G]
[B]It's not a [A]case of doing what's [B]right, it's just the [A]way I feel that [B]matters
Tell me I'm [A]wrong, I don't really [G]care

[B]It's not a [A]case of share and [B]share alike, I [A]take what I re[B]quire
I don't under[A]stand, you say it's not [G]fair

[F#]You expect me to [G]act like a lover
Con[F#]sider my moves and de[G]serve the reward
[F#]To hold you [G]in my arms and [C#m]wait ...
And [Cmaj7]wait ...
And wait for something to [B]happen [A]

[B]          [A]          [B]          [A]          [G]
[B]          [A]          [B]          [A]          [B]          [A]          [G]

[B]It's not a [A]case of telling the [B]truth, some lines just [A]fit the situ-[B]ation
Call me a [A]liar, you would anyway [G]

[B]It's not a [A]case of aiming to [B]please, you know you're [A]always crying [B]
It's just your [A]part in the [G]play for today
