{c:CHORUS}
[D]Charlie don't surf and we [Bm]think he should
[D]Charlie don't surf and you[Bm] know that it ain't no good
[D]Charlie don't surf for his [Em7]hamburger Momma
[F#m7]Charlie's gonna be a napalm star


RIFF (you can strum with a x-x-0-4-0-2 ? rather than the riff)

Everybody wants to rule the world
Must be something we get from birth
One truth is we never learn 
Satelites will make space burn

[D]We've been told to [Bm]keep the strangers out
[D]We don't like them [Bm]starting to hang around
[D]We don't like them [Em7]over town
[F#m7]Across the world we are going to mow them down

{c:CHORUS}

RIFF
The reign of the super powers must be over
So many armies can't free the earth
Soon the rock will roll over
Africa is choking on their Coca Cola 

[D]It's a one a way street in a [Bm]one horse town
[D]One way people s[Bm]tarting to bragg around
[D]You can laugh, [Em7]put them dowm 
[F#m7]These one way people gonna mow us down

{c:CHORUS}
