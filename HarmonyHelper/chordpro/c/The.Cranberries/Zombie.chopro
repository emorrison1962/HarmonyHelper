#From Phil McManus UUJ (MUFC were robbed of 2 points on 17th 
#of April 1995 by some pratt of a ref who missed a blatant handball 
#in the Chelsea box)
{t:Zombie }
{st:The Cranberries}

Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken

but you see, it's not me
it's not my family
in your head, in your head
they are fighting


{c:Chorus}

With their tanks, and their bombs, 
and their bombs, and their guns
In your head, in your head they are cryin'
In your head, In your head
Zombie, etc.
What's in your head in your head, in your head
Zombie, etc.

Another mother's breakin'
heart is taking over
when the violence causes silence
we must be mistaken
it's the same old theme since 1916
in your head,
in your head they're still fightin'

{c:Chorus}

{c:Chords are Fm, Db, G#, Gm, repeated over and over}
#I only submitted this because it was requested and
#not because I like it.  Well I used to like it until
#some fat slapper (initials LH) moved into my brothers
#house armed with her one and only CD which this happened
#to be on.  This mutt played the hole clean out of this track
#therefore this is why I dislike it so much now.  Bitch.
