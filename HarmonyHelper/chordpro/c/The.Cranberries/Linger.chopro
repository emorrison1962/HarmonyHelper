if y[D]ou
if you could return
don't let it [A]burn  don't let it fade
i'm sure i won't be [C]rude
but it's just your attitude
it's tearing me a[G]part it's ruining everyday.

I swore, I swore I would be true
but honey so did you
so why were you holding her hand
is that the way we stand
were you lying all the time
was it just a game to you

But I miss you
you know I'm such a fool for you
you got me wrapped around your finger
do you have to let it linger
do you have to
do you have to
do you have to let it linger

Oh, I thought I loved you
I thought that nothing could go wrong
but I was wrong
I was wrong

If you, if you could get by
trying not to lie
things wouldn't be so confused
and I wouldn't feel so used
but you always ruin you
I just wanna be with you

and I miss you
you know I'm such a fool for you
you got me wrapped around your finger
do you have to let it linger
do you have to
do you have to
do you have to let it linger

and I miss you
you know I'm such a fool for you
you got me wrapped around your finger
do you have to let it linger
do you have to
do you have to
do you have to let it linger

you know I'm such a fool for you
you got me wrapped around your finger
do you have to let it linger
do you have to
do you have to
do you have to let it linger
