Raise your arms in the air, and I shake 'em

[C]Suspicious minds keep talking
They're trying to tear us apart
They don't believe in this love of mine
They don't know what love is

They don't know what love is          
They don't know what love is         
They don't know what love is 
I know what love is         

Love's on the [Bb]way, ooooh[F]                (You can leave your [C]hat on)
