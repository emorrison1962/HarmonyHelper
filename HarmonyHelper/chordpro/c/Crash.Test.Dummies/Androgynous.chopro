{c:Intro:}
[G]       [D]       [Em]       [C]  

{c:Verse:}
[G]Here comes Dick, he's [D]wearing a skirt
[Em]Here comes Jane you know she's [C]sportin' a chain
[G]Same hair, a revolution
[D]Same build, evolution
[Em]Tomorrow who's gonna [C]fuss?
And they [D]love each other so, [C]androgy[G]nous
[D]Closer than you know, [C]love each other so, androgynous

Well don't get him wrong, and don't get him mad
He might be a father but he sure ain't a dad
And she don't need the advice that is sent to her
She's happy with the way she looks, she's happy with her gender
And they love each other so, androgynous
Closer than you know, love each other so, androgynous

{c:Bridge:}
[C]Mirror image, see no damage, see no evil at [Em]all
[C]Cupie dolls and urine stalls will be [Em]laughed at
The way you're [D]laughed at now

Something meets boy and something meets girl
They both look the same, they're overjoyed in this world
Same hair a revolution
Unisex evolution
Tomorrow who's gonna fuss?

And tomorrow Dick is wearing pants,
Tomorrow Jane is wearing a dress
Future outcasts and they don't last
And today people dress the way that they please
They way they tried to do in the last centuries

And they love each other so, androgynous
Closer than you know, love each other so, androgynous
