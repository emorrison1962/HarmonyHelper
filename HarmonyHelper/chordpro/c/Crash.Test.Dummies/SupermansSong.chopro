{title:Superman's Song}
{st:Crash Test Dummies}

[F]Tar[C]zan [F]wasn't a [C]ladies man 
[F]He'd just [C]come along and [F]swoop 'em up un[C]der his [Am]arm like
[G]that
[Am]Quick as a [G]cat in the [Dm]jungle [G] 
But [F]Clark [C]Kent, now [F]there was a [C]real gent
[F]He would [C]not be caught [F]sittin' aro[C]und in no [Am]jungle[G]scape
[Am]Dumb as an [G]ape doing [Dm]nothing  [G] 

{c:Chorus}
     [F]Superman never [G]made any money [C]saving the world from [F]Solomon
Grundy
     And [C]sometimes I [F]despair the [C]world will never [F]see another
[G]man like him

[F]Hey [C]Bob, [F]Supe had a [C]straight job
[F]Even [F]though he could have [F]smashed through any [C]bank in the
[Am]United [G]States
[Am]He had the [G]strength but he [Dm]would not  [G] 
[F]Folks [C]said his [F]family were [C]all dead
[F]Their planet [C]crumbled but [F]Superman he [C]forced himself to [Am]carry
[G]on
[Am]Forget Kry[G]pton and keep [Dm]going   [G] 

{c:Chorus}

[Am]Tar[G]zan was [Am]king of the [G]jungle and [F]lord over all the [C]apes
[G] 
[Am]But [G]he could [Am]hardly [G]string together [F]four wo[C]rds: " [F]I
Tar[C]zan, you [G]Jane"

[F]Some[C]times when [F]Supe was [C]stopping crimes
[F]I'll [C]bet that he was [F]tempted to just [C]quit and turn his [Am]back on
[G]man
[Am]Join Tar[G]zan in the [Dm]forest  [G] 
[F]But [C]he [F]stayed in the [C]city and [F]kept [C]changing clothes in
[F]dirty old [C]phonebooths
Til his [Am]work was [G]through and [Am]nothing to [G]do but go [Dm]on home [G]

{c:Chorus}
