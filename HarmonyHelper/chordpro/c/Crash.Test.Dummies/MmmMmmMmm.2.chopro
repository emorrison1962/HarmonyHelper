[Cm]Once [A#]there was this [D#]kid [A#]who
[G#]got into an [D#]accident and [A#]couldn't come to [D#]school, but
[G#]when he finally [A#]came [D#]back
[A#]his [D#]hair [G#]had turned from [D#]black int[A#]o bright white
He [B]said that it was [D#]from when the [B]cars had smashed [A#]soooo h[G#]ard...

Once there was this girl who
wouldn't go and change with the girls in the changeroom
and when they finally made her, 
they saw birthmarks all over her body
She couldn't quite explain it they'd always just been there

{c:Chorus (2x)}

[Fm]But both girl and [D#]boy wher[A#]e glad,
[Fm]this one kid had it [D#]worse tha[A#]n that [G#]

Cause then, there was this boy whose
parents made him come directly home right after school,
and then when they went to their church, 
their shock had leashed all over the churchfloor
He couldn't quite explain that they'd always just gone there...

{c:Chorus (2x)}

[Fm]              [D#]     [A#]
[Fm]              [D#]     [A#]
[G#]              [D#]
