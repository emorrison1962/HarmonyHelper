Here's a few pointers on how to type up your .tab and .crd files
as quickly and easily as possible...


** See also Howard Wrights INFO file on reading/writing tablature **



Step 0: DOES IT ALREADY EXIST?
~~~~~~~
Check OLGA, the music archive (see Appendix A at the end of this
file) to see if someone has already transcribed and tabbed the song.
If so, get it, check it, and mail your corrections if any to OLGA
(see below).  Make sure you credit the original poster as well as
yourself!

If the song is not in the guitar archives then you'll be starting
your transcription from scratch...


Step 1: LYRICS
~~~~~~~
USE THE LYRICS ARCHIVES!

The quickest and easiest way of entering the lyrics for a song is
simply to ftp them from the lyrics archives (see list at end).
Most files at these sites contain lyrics for a whole album, but you
can easily remove the extra songs using a text editor.  This is
certainly easier than typing out all the lyrics yourself, even if
you do manage to figure out all the garbled words in the recording!

If you find that your song is not at the lyrics archives, then you
will have to type it yourself.  But before adding chords/tab etc, why
not submit your typed words to the main lyrics archive?!  This could
save someone else the same hassle that you have just gone through.


Step 2: CHORDS
~~~~~~~
Once you have the lyrics, it is a breeze to simply enter the chord
names above the appropriate lyric.  For example:

     Em        D/F#   G
     Four seasons in one day

This can cause difficulties when people have different character
widths and tab-settings on their screens, but since most people use
standard ASCII, this is usually not a problem.  Just remember to
type in your chords/tablature using a monospaced font (if you are
not viewing this file with a monospaced font then the chords in the
example above will not be over the correct lyric!).

The other way of doing it is to embed the chords in square brackets
in the lyrics. For example:
    =20
     [Em]Four seasons [D/F#]in one [G]day

Files formatted in this way can be read by the CHORD family of
utilities (see Appenix B) to produce output of the first type,
which is considered easiest to read.

Unusual chords should be defined at the start or end of the file so
that others can easily see how to play them.  Try to name chords
correctly to reduce confusion.

USE PROGRAMS TO HELP YOU NAME UNUSUAL CHORDS!

If you are unsure of how to name a bizarre chord that you have come
across, there are several programs available to help you out (see
Appendix B).


Step 3: TABBING
~~~~~~~
There are several ways of entering ASCII tablature.  Which method you
use will depend on many factors such as whether you have previously
made a hand-written version to copy from, and how complex the tab is.

Try to use a standard format for your tablature (most specialist
tabbing programs will do this automatically).  Check out the
WHAT.IS.TAB and suggested_tab_notation.txt files in the
/resources/docs directory of OLGA (see Appendix A).

A sheet of blank tablature is very useful when transcribing songs by
ear.  This can be easily created using your friendly local graphics
package, or simply rule up the blank tab yourself and photocopy it.

IF YOU USE A TEXT EDITOR, WRITE SOME HELPFUL MACROS!

One method of entering tablature is simply to use a text editor.
This can in fact be quicker than other methods, if you have a hand-
written tab to copy from, and if you take the time to write some
useful macros for drawing new stanzas, bar-lines, repeat marks etc.
The most useful tab editors allow "vertical pasting", whereby you
may select a block of text (eg. a single bar) defined both
horizontally and vertically, without having to include the
surrounding text on each line.  One editor with vertical pasting
is MicroSoft Word (version 5 and later) for Mac or Windows.  To
select any rectangular block of text in MS Word, hold down the
Option key (Mac) or ALT key (Windows) while selecting text with
the mouse.

Another useful feature of most text editors is "overwrite" mode.
Simply create a few blank staves, switch from "insert" to "overwrite"
mode, and type in the notation.

One thing to watch out for when entering tab with a text editor is
the length of lines.  A wide variety of different people with a wide
variety of different computer systems will be using your tab, and
some of these will make life difficult if your lines of tab are too
long.  In general, you should try not to go any wider than about 70
characters.  If you are using a word-processor choose Courier 8-point
font and A4 portrait sized paper and you should be all right.

CHOOSE THE TAB PROGRAM BEST FOR YOU!

There are a wide range of programs available for entering tab (see
Appendix B).  Most of these work on one of two systems: those that
display a guitar fretboard, allowing you to select the place where
you would fret each note; and those which display a blank tablature,
allowing you to enter the number of the fret at which each note is
played.  The former are best if you are entering a tab from memory;
the latter are better if you are copying directly from your own
hand-written notes.


Step 4: SUBMITTING YOUR FILES
~~~~~~~
Once you have completed your masterpiece, you will obviously want
to share it with the world.  The most obvious way to do this is to
send it to the guitar tab news-groups.

CROSS-POST TO BOTH GUITAR TAB NEWS GROUPS

Cross-posting saves you time and effort, and minimises the load on
the news-servers.  If your news-reader allows you to, cross-post to
both tab groups by entering:
"TO: alt.guitar.tab, rec.music.makers.guitar.tablature".

Another method of cross-posting your article is to email your message
"TO: alt-guitar-tab@cs.utexas.edu"
"CC: rec-music-makers-guitar-tablature@cs.utexas.edu".

You should also submit your file for inclusion in OLGA, the guitar
archive, by emailing it to guitar@nevada.edu.  You should make sure
you include the full correct name of the song and the artist, as
well as your own email address.

PLEASE RESPECT COPYRIGHT!
COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED FOR THE GUITAR ARCHIVES!

The best bit of the whole process is the "Thank You" emails you will
recieve from fellow guitarists all around the world.  That is what
really makes your day!
