On Thursdays this article is posted under the heading:
###READ BEFORE POSTING REQUESTS### - Guide to the TAB archives (v?.?)

Last Update: 20th Feb (This (20th Feb) is the 1st posting since change)

  ** NEW IN THIS UPDATE v4.2: Eric Clapton (Slowhand) archive no longer **
  ** at daacdev1.stx.com.  New location under Special Interest Archives **
  ** NEW IN LAST UPDATE v4.0: America Online mirror for guitar archive, **
  ** with files uncompressed.  Instructions for AOL users and internet. **
  ** Guitar Archive's `other_stuff' directory replaced by `resources' . **

		      The ultimate FTP instructions
		      =============================

If you're thinking of posting a request on these newsgroups, PLEASE use these
instructions first to check the archives for the song you want.  You could
also put "(not in archive)" at the end of the Subject line in your "REQ:"
article. (Some news software will take account of preferences, so those
people who are fed up with REQ: postings for Eric Clapton Unplugged may take
more kindly to "(not in archive)" requests.)

This guide contains (hopefully) comprehensive instructions for ANY of you to
access the archives by FTP or ftpmail.  It also contains information about
guitar and music related WorldWide Web pages and where to find out about
music related mailing lists.  If it isn't comprehensive, let me know and I'll
do something about it.

What is FTP?
============
FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol.  This document is geared towards the
guitar archives but the information will be useful for other archives.  The
document is also geared mainly towards UNIX hosts, but those using FTP from
other systems should be able to do most of the same things, and the section
on FTP from MS-DOS explains the ways round the main pitfalls in using a DOS
system.


Where is this guitar archive?
=============================

The main guitar archive is maintained at the University of Nevada by Jim
Carson & Cal Woods, though there are other different sites (usually smaller,
but most still have good stuff on them).  Nevada has limited public access,
so you'll hardly ever be able to gain access directly.  It is recommended
that you use a mirror site (the most local one you can find is likely to be
best as this should give you the fastest access --- Nevada is terribly slow
when calling Transatlantic).  Use the section "How do I find my local mirror
site? (mirrors of nevada)" below to find out or if you are a user of America
OnLine, read section "How do I access the archive from AOL (America OnLine)".
There are a few smaller archives as well catering mainly for niches, like
acoustic guitar or individual artists.

Anyone who posts new crds, tabs, lyrics or chopro should (PLEASE!!) send their
contributions to guitar@nevada.edu as described below in the section entitled
"How can I submit songs to the Nevada archive?", making sure that you include
both the artist's name and song title in the subject heading of your email (e.g.
`Subject: CRD: "Into The Mystic" by Van Morrison' would be ideal).  This means
the newsgroups should have fewer REQuests posted.

Another archive specialising in Gothic/Alternative/Industrial TAB is the
Trinity College Dublin archive.  It has one mirror site (at LEO). Songs
can be submitted as described in "How can I submit songs to the Trinity
College Dublin archive?" 


ALL UNIX USERS READ THIS! - THE USER-FRIENDLY SONG RETRIEVAL UTILITY
====================================================================
This section only applies to *NIX users so far.  Robert Zawalski has
devised a utility called Autotab which does all the hard work of song
retrieval for you.  Look out for it on newsgroups alt.guitar.tab and
rec.music.makers.guitar.tablature .  It allows rapid interactive searching
of the Nevada archive (choosing the mirror sites with the best response
times automatically) and will get the song for you automatically and file
it away for you while you can be doing something else.  What's more, it
even installs itself!  If you only want to use the Nevada archives (which
is true for most of us unless we have an interest in the special interest
archives - see below) this is all you need.  Bob is hoping to make this
utility available for the lyrics archive (ftp.uwp.edu and mirrors) and
many more.


How do I find my local mirror site? (mirrors of nevada)
=======================================================
The easy way: Look it up in the section lower down this article entitled:
"Mirror sites to ftp.nevada.edu"

Or: 
If you'd like to know how to search for any file in any archive in the world
you might like to read the rest of this section.  You can do such searches
either by email or directly providing you have an "active internet site".

On UNIX systems the best way I've found to obtain the location of the nearest
mirror site is to use a search program like "archie" to look for a file known
to be on the archive.  The new maintainers have put an identification file in
the guitar archive, called Guitar.Archive.   To use  "archie"  to  find  your
nearest mirror site, type at the unix% prompt:

	archie -m4 -N Guitar.Archive

which will list up to 4 sites containing a file with the string 
"Guitar.Archive" in its name, for example:

Host unix.hensa.ac.uk

    Location: /pub/uunet/doc/music/guitar
           FILE -r--r--r--         80  Jun 16 10:21  Guitar.Archive

is the output from my local archie server.  In the archie command the "-N"
option is used to keep you system administrator happy (see man page for archie)

"Archie" is also available by telnet and email (see below) and often via your
local gateway or a server such as "NISS" (the UK's National Information
Services & Systems server).  The original archie server can be accessed by
telnet to quiche.cs.mcgill.ca [132.206.2.3 or 132.206.51.1], logging in as
user "archie".  More information about archie can be obtained by ftp from
archie.mcgill.ca directory pub/Network/archie where you'll find an article
about it.

By email, you can send a message with the word "help" in the message body to:
archie@cs.mcgill.ca which will reply automatically.


Alternatively look up one from the following lists:

The LEO Music Archive:   (formerly known as the Munich archive)
---------------------
ftp.leo.org	/pub/rec/music 	(see also above)
LEO stands for "Link Everything Online" and provides many musical resources:
 - a mirror of nevada.edu
 - a mirror of ftp.uwp.edu's lyrics files
 - a guitar department
 - a vocal department
 - The MUSIC Collection from all over the world
 - Music programs
 - Pictures (GIFs & JPEGs) and movies (MPEGs) of music artists
 - all this is accessible via the WorldWide Web (Mosaic, lynx, etc. (see below))


How do I get files from the archive?
====================================

This assumes you have an "active internet host".  To find out, run the "ftp"
program.  On most systems (Mac's excepted) you just type "ftp" at the system
prompt.  If you get a "ftp> " prompt then you should carry on reading this
sections.  If not, and you get an error message "command not found" or similar
you should use ftpmail (see the section later entitled: "I don't have real-time
internet connection or my system doesn't support ftp.  What can I do?" though
it's still a good idea to read this section, too)

First take a note of the address of the archive (eg. ftp.uwp.edu) and the
directory (eg. /pub/music/guitar) being careful with spelling and punctuation.

Use a ftp program to access the archive.  The following example is based on
mirrors of the main archive, the idea is similar for the minor archives, too.

E.G. On unix, to get to unix.hensa.ac.uk type after the "unix%" prompt:

unix% ftp unix.hensa.ac.uk

The response will be something like:

Connected to unix.hensa.ac.uk.
220 nutmeg.ukc.ac.uk FTP server (Version wu-2.4(1) Tue May 3 10:14:15 BST 1994)
ready.
Name (unix.hensa.ac.uk:rkh2): 

at which you should enter "anonymous" or "ftp" (don't type the quotes):

331 Guest login ok, send your complete e-mail address as password.
Password:

then the above appears (if there is anonymous access available at the time) so
you should type in your complete email address (such as jobloggs@funnyfarm.edu)

Then a screenful or two of information appears.  Transfers are usually logged,
so if you don't like it type "quit".

You will be advised to read the file README.  To do this type (at the "ftp>"
prompt) the following:

ftp> get README

The response will be of the form:

200 PORT command successful.
150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for README (1639 bytes).
226 Transfer complete.
1639 bytes received in 0.0021 seconds (7.7e+02 Kbytes/s)
ftp>

Then type "quit" at the "ftp>" prompt and read the file.

Once you've read it get back into the archive using the "ftp" command as before
and go to the required directory (e.g. /pub/uunet/doc/music/guitar) by typing:

ftp> cd /pub/uunet/doc/music/guitar

which responds:

250 CWD command successful.
ftp>

Now get the README file for this directory as before and read it offline.

It will SAVE you loads of TIME if you also get the file FLAT.INDEX from the
Nevada site or a mirror-site.  You can then use the SEARCH facility in your
favourite EDITOR or WORD-PROCESSOR to search for songs using strings in the
title or artist's name.

////Extra note for UNIX users:
It also allows very effective searches using UNIX's "grep" command.  To find
any files with the string "orbison" for example:

unix% grep orbison FLAT.INDEX
./h/john_wesley_harding/roy_orbison_knows.crd
./o/roy_orbison/cryin.crd
./o/roy_orbison/crying.tab
./o/roy_orbison/california_blue.tab
./o/roy_orbison/pretty_woman.tab

which finds songs with orbison in the artist or the title.  Use "grep -i" if
you need it to ignore upper/lower case distinction.  If you compress or gzip
the FLAT.INDEX you can use "zgrep" in the same way.
////End of extra note

Now, "ftp" back to the archive and the correct directory.

Music is filed under alphabetical directories, a-z by artist/band name, there
are also a few others (which cope with numerical names - I've no idea where
Prince's new material will be now he's become that symbol :-).  Also there is
the new_this_week directory and on called `resources' (which contains the
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), CHORD program, decompression programs and
lots of other resources - hence the name).  There is also the directory
`acoustic', whose subdirectories follow a similar pattern.  Also note
that in the "m" directory are various miscellaneous subdirectories: misc,
misc_childrens_songs, misc_christmas, misc_country, misc_irish, misc_musicals,
misc_showtunes, misc_soundtrack, misc_television and misc_traditional.

To view the directory you're in type "ls" at the prompt.  To see subdirectories
too, type "ls *".  Move to other directories using the "cd" command with the
full directory name.  In the "ls" command's output, directories are indicated
by a "d" as the first character in a line.  (You could also try "dir", "ls -C"
and "ls -l".).  The best commands, in my opinion, for viewing directories are
"ls -l |more" and "ls . |more".  They both prevent the list from scrolling
off the top of the screen.  The former gives a long format listing, the latter
gives it in default format.  These commands may be defined as macros using the
"macdef" command in ftp or similarly by placing it in your .netrc file (UNIX).
e.g.		macdef l
		ls . |more
allows a readable listing in default format by typing "$l" at the "ftp>"
prompt.

If you are looking for an ARTIST, look in the directory corresponding to the
first letter of their surname (eg. John Wesley Harding is under "h" in the
subdirectory "john_wesley_harding").  Some artists may have erroneously been
filed under their first name.  Most of the Van Morrison material, for example,
was once filed under "v", so it's worth checking.

If you're looking for a BAND, look in the directory corresponding to the first
letter of the band's name ignoring "The" in the case of bands like The Who,
which should be under "w".  Thus, Crowded House is under "c".  Simple, eh?

SIMPLER still, you can get FLAT.INDEX and search it (see above for details) -
that way you don't miss erroneously filed songs/artists and you don't waste
time whilst logged into the FTP site and fill up the limited number of
anonymous FTP logins available.

To get files, use the "get" command as explained for getting the README file,
above.  Also if you want to "get" a file but save it under a new name, you can
use the form:

ftp> get roy_orbison_knows.crd rorbison.crd

which gives you a file on your disk drive called rorbison.crd - important for
users of DOS with the 8-dot-3 naming restriction.

The "mget" command, e.g. "mget *" or "mget *.crd" is used to get multiple
files.  You will usually be prompted for a yes or no before you get each one.

One more thing on FTP.  If you're not transferring ASCII text, or are ftping
compressed files you MUST use BINARY mode (type 'bin' at the 'ftp>' prompt)


Why can't I read songs with a ".Z" or ".gz" suffix?
===================================================
These files are compressed.
The ".Z" files need unix's "uncompress" command to remove the ".Z" and make
them readable (this is also available for DOS from various ftp sites - try
an archive search for "comp430d.exe" or "comp430d.zip", the latter of which
needs the "pkunzip.exe" utility to uncompress it), and the ".gz" files need
"gunzip" to uncompress them (available from some ftp sites - search for
"gunzip.exe").  There are also Mac utilities compatible with these formats.
The DOS program comp430d.exe needs a little explanation.  To uncompress a
file use the form:
			comp430d <filename> -d

If you don't have "uncompress" or "gunzip" you can uncompress them "on the fly"
at most ftp sites by simply leaving off the ".Z" or ".gz" extension in the
"get filename" command.  This does mean that the transfer takes longer,
however.


What's special about sites with "On-the-fly" facilities?
========================================================
At the lowest level, this allows compressed files (with a ".Z" extension) to
be uncompressed before they are transmitted to you simply by leaving off the
".Z" extension in the "get" command.  This makes the transfer take longer, but
if you can't uncompress the file at your site, it's the only option.

It also allows you to compress files by adding a ".Z" extension where there
isn't one, thus reducing transfer time.

Some versions, can cope with "gzip" and "gunzip" compression and decompression
in the same way (compressed files denoted by ".gz" extensions).  The version
is usually described in the introduction screen or main README file at the
site in question.

{WARNING: Fairly advanced features below - feel free to go to next section}

Some versions can also cope with "get"ting entire directories (using "tar")
by adding a ".tar" to the directory name, and can compress the "tar" files too
by adding ".tar.Z" etc.  This must be done from the directory below the one
you wish to extract.  E.G. To get the whole of the john_wesley_harding direc-
tory which is under /whatever/guitar/h/john_wesley_harding you should get into
directory /whatever/guitar/h then type:

ftp> get john_wesley_harding.tar

A file "john_wesley_harding.tar" will be sent to you.  To extract it quit the
FTP program and (if you're using UNIX) type:

unix% tar xvf john_wesley_harding.tar

to get a response like:
x john_wesley_harding/long_dead_gone.crd.Z, 5641 bytes, 12 tape blocks
x john_wesley_harding/backing_out.crd.Z, 1989 bytes, 4 tape blocks
x john_wesley_harding/i_can_tell.crd.Z, 2789 bytes, 6 tape blocks
x john_wesley_harding/save_a_little_room_for_me.crd.Z, 3260 bytes, 7 tape blocks
x john_wesley_harding/the_peoples_drug.crd.Z, 2768 bytes, 6 tape blocks
x john_wesley_harding/the_person_you_are.tab.Z, 3878 bytes, 8 tape blocks

Then remove the tar file using:
unix% rm john_wesley_harding.tar

You now have a new directory called john_wesley_harding.  The files in it are
in exactly the same form as they were on the archive.  So if they were
compressed there, they are in your directory.  Also the permission modes are
the same.  If you want to be able to write to files you must change it using
a command such as "chmod 644 filename" where the filename could also be a
wildcard like "*".  Again this applies to UNIX.

It's not usually worth compressing "tar"red directories on-the-fly using the
same compression type as that used for the files inside, since there's very
little saving in space, but if they are ".Z" type, then using the ".gz"
extension (where available) may achieve a useful compression, i.e. type:
ftp> get john_wesley_harding.tar.gz
Then use "unix% gunzip john_wesley_harding.tar.gz" before using the tar
command.

Unfortunately, if you want to change the compression type of the files inside
a directory on-the-fly, it won't work and you must extract them one-by-one or
or change the format after transfer.


How do I access the archive from AOL (America OnLine)
=====================================================
After the inrush of new net users nearly crippled the mother site of the
Guitar Archive, America OnLine have kindly provided a mirror site to ease
the load.  If you are not an America OnLine user, this mirror and the
instructions you need are above.

To access the Guitar Archive thorugh AOL software:
Select	Go To 
	Keyword	 
Type 	internet
	FTP review  
enter the FTP area 
	FTP
the mirror is listed as one of the "favorite sites". 

Please email me <rkh2@ukc.ac.uk> and/or the Guitar Archive's maintainers
<guitar@nevada.edu> if any of this procedure changes (for example if the
guitar archive moves off the "favorite sites" list).


Added notes on using FTP from MS-DOS
====================================
MS-DOS has a file-naming structure which is incompatible with the types used
on the guitar archives - namely the eight characters followed by a dot
followed by three characters convention.  So a file which contains more than
one dot cannot be saved on the DOS file system under that name.  To get around
this when using FTP from DOS the "get" command allows a new name to be
specified, thus:
ftp> get mr_jones.crd.Z jones.Z
will get the file called mr_jones.crd.Z on the archive and save it as JONES.Z
on your disk drive.  Note that this is a compressed file (the .Z extension),
so to get it correctly you needed to be in BINary transfer mode and to read it
you'll need COMP430D.EXE (see above) to uncompress it using the command
"comp430d JONES.Z -d" at the DOS prompt, which should give you a file in
readable form.  You may rename this as you wish.  Note also that some DOS
utilities may require that files have extra line-feed characters added with
carriage-returns.    Let me know if there's an easy way to do this and you'll
be made famous with an acknowledgement at the end (Wey hey!).
If the filename has a ".gz" extension you can get "gzip" from the ./resources
directory of the Guitar Archive and use a command like
"gzip -d -a -s c:\filename" to convert to normal text.
If you wish to view crd and tab files on a wordprocessor use a mono-spaced
font (i.e. one where "i" and "m" have the same width) such as Courier 10pt
or similar.


What if I don't know the artist's name?
=======================================
Two options I know of:
1) Use a searchable index.  The only one I know of at the moment is in LEO
   only available for WWW access (i.e Mosaic, lynx, etc.) at the URL below:
   http://www.leo.org/cgi-bin/music_index and also as a link from the LEO
   Music archive WWW page (see end of document) which searches their mirrors
   of the various music archives.

2) "get" the FLAT.INDEX or INDEX files from Nevada or a mirror, maybe the
   lyrics site and ftp.maths.tcd.ie and search them, perhaps with your
   favourite text editor or word-processor.


How can I submit songs to the Nevada archive?
=============================================
Firstly, check the songs for accuracy, avoiding copyright infringements, then
simply email the songs to:

	guitar@nevada.edu

Make sure you include the artist and title and your (the transcriber's) name
in the text, and please use a subject line of the form:

	Subject: CRD: "I Can Tell" by John Wesley Harding
or	Subject: /h/john_wesley_harding/i_can_tell.crd

using the suffix "crd" for lyrics and chords, "lyr" for lyrics only,
"tab" for tablature and "pro" for songs in CHORD/CHORDPRO format.  Use your
discretion when naming files for songs with brackets and other unusable
characters in the title, like the above song which is actually called
"I Can Tell (When You're Telling Lies)" in which both the brackets and the
apostrophe are unusable.  From Nevada's /pub/guitar/README file is a summary
of suffixes:

Suffix Conventions

        *.lyr           The file contains the lyrics to the song named.
        *.crd           The file contains chords for the named song.
        *.tab           The file contains (at least some) tab for the
                        named song.
        *.pro           The file contains chords for the named song
                        in 'Chord.Pro' format.
        *.btab          The file contains tab for the bass guitar
                        for the named song.
        *.ps            The file is a 'Postscript' file.
        *.gif           The file is a gif file (usually of tab.)

Chord files usually contain lyrics.
Tab files usually contain both chords and lyrics.


How can I submit songs to the Trinity College Dublin archive?
=============================================================
First ensure that the contributor's name and email address are included in the
file to be sent, and put the song title and artist in the filename, as well as
the type of file (e.g. crd, tab): see below:

//////included from README file for /pub/music/guitar at ftp.maths.tcd.ie//////
Small letters are used throughout. Many-worded titles are separated by
underscores. 

      *.lyr = Lyrics for a particular song.
      *.crd = Chords for the guitar
      *.pro = Chords in 'chordpro' format.
      *.tab = Tab for the (lead) guitar.
      *.btab = Bass tab

Chord and tab files usually contain lyrics; tab files often contain chords.
Files containing whole albums are denoted by *_album.*
Any file with a .Z extension should be transferred in binary mode.

Submissions
If you wish to contribute to ftp.maths.tcd.ie, the way to do
so is to use the 'put' command in ftp.
You _must_ place files in /pub/music/incoming.
You can only 'put' at ftp.maths.tcd.ie NOT at a mirror site.
Again, we promise swift filing in the main body of the archive.
Thanks!

Any comments to morpheus@maths.tcd.ie 
Thank you for using this archive!
//////end included text//////

In summary:

Open an FTP session at ftp.maths.tcd.ie using the ftp command as described
above.  Once logged in type:

ftp> cd /pub/music/incoming

Then if the file you want to submit is called "crazy_love.van_morrison.tab":

ftp> put crazy_love.van_morrison.tab

The file should transfer (use ls or dir to check) and the archive promises to
put all material on the archive swiftly (usually a few days).


I don't have real-time internet connection or my system doesn't support ftp. 
============================================================================
What can I do?
==============
You can get access via ftpmail.  This is basically an offline request version
of the interactive "ftp" command detailed earlier.  I know of the following
ftpmail services:

ftpmail@sunsite.unc.edu

ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com	

mailserver@leo.org  (only for LEO mirror & music archive)

[Note: these are internet addresses - if you use a non-internet email service
like FIDOnet, compuserve or bitnet you may need to modify the address.  Email
me if you don't know how to do this.  I'd like to add this to the guide so if
anyone on these services would like to help (5 minutes of your time) email me]

Of these the ftpmail@sunsite.unc.edu service looks most user-friendly.

There is another ftpmail server which I only recommend using if you have
access to "uudecode", "uud" or "xxencode".  It does offer HELP in HOWTOFTP and
also for users of VMS.  It's address is bitftp@pucc.bitnet.

The server at the address mailserver@leo.org provides simple access to
the LEO archives only.  It also requires that the user is able to "uudecode"
and "gunzip" the files which are returned in their email messages since it will
not decompress files "on-the-fly".  It must therefore use the file names listed
at the LEO site (usually those from INDEX and FLAT.INDEX but with a ".gz"
extension added.)  For more info ask for help as below.

To get further instructions, you should email the appropriate server with the
subject "HELP" and message body "help".  For example, to get more info from
all these services send the message between the === lines below.  If you
don't wish to use the mailserver@leo.org service don't send
the carbon-copy to that address.
===
To: ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com,ftpmail@sunsite.unc.edu
Cc: mailserver@leo.org
~Subject: HELP

help
quit
===

A reply will automatically be despatched to you usually within minutes of the
server receiving the email (not necessarily within minutes of you sending it!).

Use the instructions and PLEASE let me know of any pitfalls or ambiguities you
encounter and tell me which servers you prefer.  To access the Nevada archive,
you should send a message of roughly the following form (this is in sunsite
syntax):

open ftp.uwp.edu
cd pub/music/guitar
get FLAT.INDEX
quit

This will obtain the index of the archive which should reach you in a day or so
if not a minute or less.  (If the file FLAT.INDEX can't be found, it may be
currently saved under another name so try again with this or try the command
"cd pub/music/guitar" then "ls" to find out what it's called).  You can search
FLAT.INDEX with an editor or word-processor or, in UNIX, the grep command.  For
example, in UNIX, to find any songs with "mystic" in them, I type:

grep mystic FLAT.INDEX

and the response is:

./c/camel/mystic_queen
./m/bob_marley/natural_mystic.crd
./m/van_morrison/into_the_mystic.crd

At other sites without an index file you'll need to use the "ls" command to get
directories.  If you move to the /pub/music/guitar or whatever the root
directory is using the "cd" command, you might find out the contents of all
subdirectories using a command like "ls -rf" then save the reply to a file.

To get a file such as into_the_mystic.crd, don't include any ".Z" extension
named in the index or listing unless you use BINARY mode and can "uncompress"
and "uudecode" files, just send the following sort of message body:

open ftp.uwp.edu
cd pub/music/guitar
get ./m/van_morrison/into_the_mystic.crd
quit

You'll be sent the file in a day or maybe a minute.  To get more than one
file, send more "get" commands on different lines of the message.  The "mget"
command is not available on most ftpmail servers.

Let me know how you get on, ftpmailers!  (I don't mind the extra mail)


Can I get files from the archive offline, while I do something else?
====================================================================

There's a utility called 'getit' which is available at the Nevada archive in
binary and source-code form.  Binaries are available for UNIX and DOS.  (The
DOS version is getit.exe).  The files for both UNIX & DOS are in the directory
?/guitar/resources/unix_misc/GETIT .  Remember that to receive the binaries
you need to use 'ftp' in binary mode (type 'bin' at the 'ftp>' prompt). 
Bob Zawalski's excellent autotab utility for UNIX uses getit and adds an
excellent user-friendly interface..

Alternatively you can use ftpmail as described above.  This also puts a very
small load on the archive due to it's short access time, hopefully improving
access.

How to use 'getit' on UNIX:
--------------------------

Make sure the file permission lets you execute getit ('man chmod' for
details).  The program 'getit' extracts files from an archive.

Either
	getit host:path/file
-or-
	getit path/file:host
-or-
	getit ftp://host/path/file

For example, at the unix prompt:
	unix% getit ftp.uwp.edu:pub/music/guitar/FLAT.INDEX &
The '&' makes it run in the background, letting you do other things.  When
it's finished you'll have the file FLAT.INDEX in your directory (assuming ftp
access was available).


World Wide Web (WWW) sites for music, artist and guitar-related stuff
=====================================================================
These are the WWW sites I am aware of which are likely to be of interest to
the readers of this newsgroup.  To use WWW you will need a program such as
Mosaic or lynx.  The URL addresses of the sites are listed below with a brief
description of some of the contents:

"WWW Music Resources Index 1"
http://www.cecer.army.mil/~burnett/MDB/musicResources.html
Hyperlinks to loads of WWW Music resources including loads of artist-related
sites and some musical-style related "gig-lists" though mainly US oriented.

"WWW Music Resources Index 2"
http://www.dsv.su.se/matti-hu/music.html
Similar to above.

"Guitarland"
file://ftp.netcom.com/pub/jcarson/guitar/gl.html
Hyperlinks to all the major guitar archives (Nevada - general, Linfield -
acoustic, & Trinity College Dublin (classical & alternative/gothic/industrial))
Remote sites for the guitar newsgroups and the TAB groups FAQ.
Guitar Lessons on-line.
Guitarland is currently "under construction" so I guess it will grow.

"LEO music archive"
http://www.leo.org/archiv/music/music_e.html
Also available in German (same address but omit "music_e.html")
Info about big events (like Woodstock '94)
Hyperlinks to a Nevada mirror, Trinity College Dublin mirror and a mirror of 
the ftp.uwp.edu lyrics server.
Gopher searchable index for music documents on-site (very handy indeed)
Quite a lot of pictures (GIFs & JPEGs) and movies (MPEGs).
Links to other WWW band sites & WWW general music pages as well as various
FTP sites.

"ChordPro archive WWW-link"
http://www.nada.kth.se/~f91-jsc
Various wonderful things related to the ChordPro guitar archive including a
searchable index of the archive to find the songs quickly and easily for you.


Mailing-lists: How to find out about them
=========================================
A List of Musical Mailing Lists (LoMML) is maintained by Myra Wong
<mkwong@ucsd.edu> and posted to rec.music.info.  If you wish to obtain a copy
try one of the following methods:
- Use the "finger" command: "finger mkwong@sdcc13.ucsd.edu" or to save it as
  a file, use "finger mkwong@sdcc13.ucsd.edu > listinfo.txt"
- Get it by FTP or ftpmail at location ftp.uwp.edu:/pub/incoming/faq/lomml
- Get it from the World Wide Web (WWW) using a browser such as lynx or Mosaic
  from http://server.berkeley.edu/~ayukawa/lomml.html
- If none of these are possible, then request it by email to Myra Wong at
  mkwong@sdcc13.ucsd.edu and be patient - Myra has to process requests
  manually.
