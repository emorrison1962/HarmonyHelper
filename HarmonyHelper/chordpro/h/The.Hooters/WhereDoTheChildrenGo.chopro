{c:Verse}
[A]Surrender into the [D]night
[A]Silently take my [D]hand
[E]Nobody knows whats [D]inside us[A]
[D]Nobody under-[E]stands

They [A]handed us down a [D]dream
To [A]live in this lonely [D]town
But [E]nobody hears the [D]music[A]
[D]Only the echo of a [E]hollow sound

{c:Chorus}
[E]Where do the [D]child-[A]ren [E]go
Between the [D]bright [A]night and [D]darkest [E]day
Where do the [D]child-[A]ren [E]go
And who's that [D]deadly [A]piper that [E]leads them [A]away

{c:Verse 2 (same as verse 1)}

Together we make our way
Passengers on a train
Whisper a secret forever
Promises in the rain

We're leaving it all behind
While castles are falling down
We're going where no one can find us
And if there's a heaven we'll find it somehow
