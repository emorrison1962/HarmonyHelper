[F]On Preston [G]platform do your [C]soft shoe [C/B]shuffle [Am]dance
[F]Brush away the [G]cigarette ash that's [G]falling down your [D]pants

[F]And you sadly [G]wonder
Does the [C]nurse treat [C/B]your old [Am]man the way she [D]should?

She [F]made you tea, asked [C]for your auto[Am]graph.  
What a [D]laugh.  [Bsus]                              [F#]
