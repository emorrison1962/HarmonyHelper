L[C]ost my partner, skip to my Lou
L[G7]ost my partner, skip to my Lou
L[C]ost my partner, skip to my Lou
Sk[G7]ip to my Lou my d[C]arling
Skip, skip, skip to my Lou
Sk[G7]ip, skip, skip to my Lou
Sk[C]ip, skip, skip to my Lou
Sk[G7]ip to my Lou my d[C]arling

{c:Varianter}
I'll get another one, sweeter, too
Rabbit on the hillside, big as a mule
Flies in the buttermilk, two by two
My girl wears a number nine shoe
When I go courting I take two
