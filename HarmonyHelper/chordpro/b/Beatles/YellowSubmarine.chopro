{title:Yellow Submarine}
{st:John Lennon/Paul McCartney}
In the [D]town where [C]I was [G]born
[Em]Lived a [Am]man who sailed the [D]sea.
And he told us [C]of his [G]life
[Em]In the [Am]land of subma[D]rines.

So we sailed up to the sun
'Till we found the sea of green,
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine.

     [G]We all live in a [D]yellow submarine,
     Yellow submarine, [G]yellow submarine.
     [G]We all live in a [D]yellow submarine,
     Yellow submarine, [G]yellow submarine.

And our friends are all aboard,
Many more of them live next door,
And the band begins to play.

     We all live in a yellow submarine,
     Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
     We all live in a yellow submarine,
     Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.

As we live a life of ease,
Everyone of us has all we need.
Sky of blue and sea of green
In our yellow submarine.

     We all live in a yellow submarine,
     Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
     We all live in a yellow submarine,
     Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
