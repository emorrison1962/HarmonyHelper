{title:Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds}
{subtitle:Lennon/McCartney}
                           
Pi[A]cture your[A7]self in a [D]boat on a [D/F]river 
With ta[A]ngerine [A7]trees and m[D]armalade [D/F]skies      [G]
Som[A]ebody [A7]calls you, you [D]answer quite [D/F]slowly
A [A]girl with cale[A7]idoscope [D]eyes.     [Dm]         [C]

C[Bb]ellophane flowers of [C]yellow and green [F]towering over your [Bb]head.
[C]Look for the girl with the [G]sun in her eyes and she's [D]gone

{c:Chorus}
     [G]Lucy in the [C]Sky with [D]Diamonds.  
     [G]Lucy in the [C]Sky with [D]Diamonds
     [G]Lucy in the [C]Sky with [D]Diamonds.  
     [D]Ahhhhhh[A]hhhhhh.

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
where rockinghorse-people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers 
that grow so incredibly high

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in your hand and you're gone

{c:Chorus}

Picture yourself in a train in a station
with plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
the girl with kaleidoscope eyes

{c:Repeat chorus till fade}
