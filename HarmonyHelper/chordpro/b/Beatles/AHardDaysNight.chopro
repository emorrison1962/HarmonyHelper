It's been A [G]Hard [C9]Day's [G]Night and I've been [F]working like a [G]dog
It's been A Hard [C9]Day's [G]Night I should be [F]sleeping like a [G]log
But when I [C]get home to you I find the [D]things that you do will
make me [G]feel [C9]al---[G]right
{eoc}

You know I work all day to get you money to buy things
And It's worth it just to hear you say you're gonna give me ev'rything
So why I love to come home 'Cause when I get you alone you know I'll be O.K.

{c:Bridge:}
     When I [Bm]home [Em]ev'rything seems to be al[Bm]right
     When I'm [G]home [Em]feeling you holding me [C]tight, [D]tight,yeah

{c:Chorus}

{c:Solo}

So why I love to come home 'Cause when I get you alone you know I'll be O.K.

{c:Bridge}

{c:Chorus}
          
You know I [G]feel [C9]al---[G]right
