I'll pretend that I'm kissing
the lips I am missing
and hope that my dreams will come true.
And then while I'm away I'll write home every day,
and I'll send all my loving to you.

Close your eyes and I'll kiss you,
tomorrow I'll miss you,
remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away I'll write home every day,
and I'll send all my loving to you.

{c:Chorus}
