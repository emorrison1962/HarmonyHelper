[A]I think I'm gonna be sad - 
I think it's today yeah
the girl that's driving me mad 
is going [Bm]away [E7]

     [F#m]She's got a ticket to [D7]ride 
     [F#m]she's got a ticket to [Gmaj7]   ri- [G6]  hi-  [G6#11]hide
     [F#m]she's got a ticket to [E7]ride - but she don't [A]care

She said that living with me 
is bringing her down yeah
for she would never be free 
when I was around

     {c: chorus}

I [D7]don't know why she's riding so high
she oughta think twice 
she oughta do right by [E7]me
[D7]Before she gets to saying goodbye

she oughta do right by [E7]me
