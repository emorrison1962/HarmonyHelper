{t:I Saw Her Standing There}
{st:The Beatles}

Well she was j[A]ust seventeen, if you k[D7]now what I m[A]ean
And the way she looked was way beyond comp[E7]are,
So h[A]ow could I d[A7]ance with an[D]other,  [F]   when I s[A]aw her st[E7]anding th[A]ere.

Well s[A]he looked at me, and [D7]I, I could[A] see, 
That before too long I'd fall in love with [E7]her.
S[A]he wouldn't d[A7]ance with an[D]other,  [F]   when I s[A]aw her s[E7]tanding t[A]here.

Well my h[D7]eart went boom when I crossed that room,
And I held her hand in m[E]ine...     

Well we da[A]nced through the night, and we h[D7]eld each other t[A]ight,
And before too long I fell in love with h[E7]er.
Now I[A]'ll never d[A7]ance with an[D]other,  [F]   since I s[A]aw her st[E7]anding th[A]ere.

Instrumental same as verse

Well my h[D7]eart went boom when I crossed that room,
And I held her hand in m[E]ine...     

Well we da[A]nced through the night, and we h[D7]eld each other t[A]ight,
And before too long I fell in love with h[E7]er.
Now I[A]'ll never d[A7]ance with an[D]other,  [F]   since I s[A]aw her st[E7]anding th[A]ere.
Since I s[A]aw her st[E7]anding th[A]ere.
Since I s[A]aw her st[E7]anding th[A]ere.
