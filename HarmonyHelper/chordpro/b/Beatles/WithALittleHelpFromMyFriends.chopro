{t:With a Little Help From My Friends}
{st:Lennon-McCartney}

Wh[C]at would you do if I sang [Dm]out of tune,
would you stand [G7]up and walk [G7]out on me?
Le[C]nd me your ears and I'll sing[Dm] you a song
and I'll try [G7]not to sing [G7]out of key[C].

{c:Chorus}
{soc}
     [C]Oh, I get by [Bb]with a little hel[F]p from my friend[C]s.
     Oh, I get high[Bb] with a little help [F]from my friends[C]
     Mm, I'm gonna try[Bb] with a little help [F]from my friends.[C]
     Do you need[Am7] anybo[D7]dy? - I ne[C]ed somebo[Bb]dy to love.
     [F]Could it be[Am7] anybo[D7]dy? - I [C]want somebo[Bb]dy to love.[F]
{eoc}

What do I do when my love is away,
does it worry you to be alone?
How do I feel by the end of the day,
are you sad because you're on your own?

{c:Chorus}

Would you believe in a love at first sight?
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time.
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you but I know it's mine.

{c:Chorus}
