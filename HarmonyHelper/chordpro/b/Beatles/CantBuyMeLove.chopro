Can't buy me l[G#m]ove   [C#m],     l[G#m]ove   [C#m],  can't buy me
l[F#m7]o------v[B7]e.

I'll [E]buy you a diamond ring my friend, if it [E7]makes you feel alright.
I'll [A7]get you anything my friend, if it [E]makes you feel alright.
For [B7]I don't care too [A7]much for money, for [B7]money can't [A7]buy me [E]love.

I'll give you all I've got to give, if you say you love me too.
I may not have a lot to give but what I've got I give to you.
For I don't care too much for money, for money can't buy me love.

Can't buy me l[G#m]ove   [C#m],    e[A7]v'rybody tells me so.
[E] Can't buy me l[G#m]ove   [C#m],     [F#m7]no, no, no, [B7]no.
{eoc}

Say you don't need no diamond ring and I'll be satisfied.
Tell me that you want those kind of things that money just can't buy.
For I don't care too much for money, for money can't buy me love.
