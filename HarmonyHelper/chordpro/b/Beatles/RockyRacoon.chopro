{c:Spoken:}
[Am7]Now somewhere in the Black Mountain hills of [D7]Dakota
there lived a young boy named Rocky Rac[G7]coon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
[C]Hit young Rocky in the eye
[C/B]Rocky didn't like that, 
[Am7]he said I'm gonna get that boy [D7]
So one d[G7]ay he walked into town 
and booked himself a r[C]oom in a local s[C/B]aloon

{c:Sing:}
[Am7]Rocky Raccoon, checked i[D7]nto his room, 
o[G7]nly to find Gideon's Bi[C]ble. [C/B]
[Am7]Rocky had come, e[D7]quipped with a gun, 
to s[G7]hoot off the legs of his ri[C]val [C/B]
His ri[Am7]val it seems, had b[D7]roken his dreams, 
by s[G7]tealing the girl of his fan[C]cy [C/B]
Her n[Am7]ame was McGill, And she c[D7]alled herself Lil, 
but e[G7]veryone knew her as N[C]ancy [C/B]

Now she and her man, who called himself Dan, 
were in the next room at the hoedown
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin, 
he said "Danny boy, this is a showdown."
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot, 
and Rocky collapsed in the corner.

Now the doctor came in, stinking of gin, and proceeded to lie on the table
He said, "Rocky, you met your match," 
but Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch
and I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able."

Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room only to find Gideons Bible
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt 
to help with good Rocky's revival.
