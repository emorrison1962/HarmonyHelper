[D]I once had a [D/C#]girl or should I [D]say [C]she once [G]had [D]me
[D]She showed me[D/C#] her room isn't it [D]good [C]Norweg[G]ian [D]wood

She [Dm]asked me to stay and she told me to sit any[G]where
But [Dm]I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a [Em]chair[A]

[D]I sat on a [D/C#]rug biding my [D]time [C]drinking [G]her [D]wine
[D]We talked until [D/C#]two and then she [D]said [C]it's time [G]for [D]bed

She [Dm]told me she worked in the morning and started to [G]laugh
I [Dm]told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the [Em]bath[A]

[D]And when I a[D/C#]woke I was a[D]lone [C]this bird [G]had [D]flown
[D]So I lit a [D/C#]fire isn't it [D]good [C]Norwe[G]gian [D]wood
