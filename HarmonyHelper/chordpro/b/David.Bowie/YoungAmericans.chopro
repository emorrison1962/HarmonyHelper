{t:Young Americans}
{st:David Bowie}

[C]They pulled in just behind the fridge 
[G]He laid her down - he frowns
[Dm]Gee my life's a funny thing
[F]Am I still too young
[C]He kissed then and there
[G]She took his ring took his babies
[Dm]It him minutes took her nowhere
[F]Heaven knows she'd've taken anything

[Em]All nig[F#m]ht - she wants the young American
[Em]It's all rig[F#m]ht - but she wants the young American

Scanning life through the picture window
She finds the slinky vagabond
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang
Heaven forbid she'll taken anything
But the freak and his type - all for nothing
He misses a step and cuts his hand
Showing nothing he swoops like a song
She cries where have all papa's heroes gone

All night - she wants the young American
It's all right - but she wants the young American

All the way from Washington
Her breadwinner begs of the bathroom floor
We live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for fifty more

All night - she wants the young American
It's all right - but she wants the young American

Do you remember president Nixon
Do you remember all the bills you have to pay
or even yesterday .................................
