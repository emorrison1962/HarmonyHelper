[B]You and I will [A]meet again
[E]When we're least ex[A]pecting [B]it
Oneday in some [A]fare off place
[E]I will reco[A]gnize your [B]face
[Bm7]I Won't say good-[A]bye my [E]friend
For [A]you and [E]I will [A]meet [E]again 

[B] [Bm7] [B] [Bm7]

I heard you singing to no one
I saw you dancing all alone
Oneday you belonged to me
Next day I just wouldn't know
Oneday all the rules will bent
and you and I will meet again

I've got a [A]fee[E]ling 
I've got a [A]fee[E]ling so [B]strong
Maybe [A]some[E]day [A]our [E]roads will [B]cross

A red winged hawk is circling
The blacktop stretches out for days
How could I get so close to you
and still feel so far away
I hear a voice come on the wind
Sayin' you and I will meet again
I don't know how. I don't know when
But you and I will meet again
