The CHORDPRO Guitar Archive at nada.kth.se    Last updated: 20/Oct/95

This guitar archive is an anonymous ftp server containing 3065
guitartunes formatted for the CHORD utility. The CHORD utility
is copyright by Martin Leclerc (Martin.Leclerc@Sun.COM) and 
Mario Dorion (Mario.Dorion@Sun.COM). 

This archive is mirroring nevada's collection of CHORDPRO songs
as well as most all CHORDPRO songs posted to both newsgroups
alt.guitar.tab and rec.music.makers.guitar.tablature.
In addition I am converting songs which are in a fairly good
chord format to the CHORDPRO format.

If you want to make a contribution to the archive please read 
the notice on submissions below.

* The structure of this archive is as follows:

	./INDEX			: A nicely formatted index of all songs and files 
				  at this archive.

	./FLAT.INDEX		: Another index especially useful for 'grep'
				  and for use with the 'getit' util.

	./Documents/		: Directory containing some useful information and 
				  documents (FAQ v4.2, Sample .chordrc file, a list
				  of all available guitar Software and a Postscript 
				  ChordChart)

	./Incoming/		: In this directory you can 'put' your submissions.
			  	  See note below!

	./Programs/		: The CHORD program (version 3.5, 3.6) + Other
				  utility programs.

	./README		: This README file.

	./New.<month>		: A list of new/updated files during the month <month>.

	./All_<month>.tar.gz	: All new/updated songs in a gzip'ed tar archive.

	./New.This.Week		: List of files new/updated/modified the last 7 days.

	./<letter>/<artist>	: The songs themselve... See on naming conventions
				  below.

** Naming conventions.
  Artists are archived by their last name. Groupnames with prefix 'The.Group'
  are archived alphabetically by groupname not under 't'.
  Examples:
  The songs of Bryan Adams and Tom Petty are archived as:
	./a/Bryan.Adams/
	./p/Tom.Petty/
  For groups as The Cure or The Zombies:
	./c/The.Cure/
	./z/The.Zombies/

** Suffix conventions.
  That's an easy one... There is only one! All files, if they contain 
  a song, have the suffix *.chopro as this is a CHORDPRO archive :)
  
** Submissions      
  Contributions to the archive are as always very welcomed. If you want 
  to submit a file either send it by mail to:

	f91-jsc@nada.kth.se

  Or ftp it to the ./Incoming directory at this archive (See for help
  on ftp below or read the FAQ 'Guide to the guitar archives'). When sub-
  mitting a file please make sure the file contains title and author/artist. 

!! Due to copyright law no files that contain material taken from 
!! songbooks or magazines will be archived at this archive.
 
  As this is a CHORDPRO archive, files in CHORDPRO format are especially
  welcome; but crd format songs are welcomed as well and I'll try to
  convert them myself.
  Collections of files in formats as shar, zip, gzip, tar are accepted.
