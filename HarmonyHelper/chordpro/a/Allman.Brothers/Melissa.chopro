[E]Crossroads [F#m]seem to come and [G#m]go      [F#m]
[E]The gypsy flys from coast to [F#m]coast
[A]Knowing [Bm]many loving [C#m]none  [D]
[E]Bearing [F#m]sorrow having [G#m]fun     [F#m]
[Cmaj7]But back home he'll always [B]run, to see Me[E]lissa    [F#m]        [G#m]          [F#m]

[E]Freight train, [F#m]each car looks the [G#m]same   [F#m]
[E]No one knows the gypsy's [F#m]name
[A]And no one [Bm]hears his lonely [C#m]sigh    [D]
[E]There are no [F#m]blankets where he [G#m]lies   [F#m]
[Cmaj7]Beneath his dreams the gypsy [B]flies, with sweet Me[E]lissa     [F#m]         [G#m]          [F#m]

{c:Bridge}
[E]Again the morning comes [F#]Again he's on the run
[A]Sunbeam shining through his hair [B]Care enough to have a care
[C#m]Pick up your gear and gypsy [A]roll on, [B]roll on

[E]Crossroads, [F#m]will you ever let him [G#m]go   [F#m]
[E]Will you hide the dead man's [F#m]ghost
[A]Will he [Bm]lie beneath the [C#m]clay   [D]
[E]Will his [F#m]spirit float [G#m]away    [F#m]
[Cmaj7]But I know that he won't [B]stay, without Me[E]lissa  [F#m]
[Cmaj7]But I know that he won't [B]stay, without Me[E]lissa  [F#m]
[Cmaj7]But I know that he won't [B]stay, without Me[E]lissa  [F#m]         [G#m]         [F#m]          [E]
