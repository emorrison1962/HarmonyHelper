[E]Walk along the [B]river, [A]sweet lulla[E]by, it just keeps on [B]flowing,
[A]It don't worry 'bout where it's going, no, no[E]     [A]
[E]Don't fly, mister blue[B]bird, I'm just [A]walking down the [E]road,
Early morning sun[B]shine [A]tell me all I need to know[E]     [A]

{c:Chorus}
     [B]You're my [A]blue sky, [E]you're my sunny [A]day.

     Turn your love my [F#m7]way, yeah[E]
