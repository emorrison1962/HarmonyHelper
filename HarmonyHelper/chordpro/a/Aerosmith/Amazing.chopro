Intro: [Am] - [G] - [Am] - [G]

I kept the right [Am]ones out and let the [G]wrong ones in
Had an ang[C]el of mercy to see me through all my sin[F]s
There were [Fm/G#]times in my life when I was [C/G]goin' insane
[D/F#]Tryin' to walk through the pain[F]
When I los[Am]t my grip and I [Em/A]hit the floor
Yeah, I tho[C]ught I could leave but couldn't get out the doo[F]r
I was [Fm/G#]so sick and tired of [C/G]livin' a lie
I was [D/F#]wishin' that I would die[F]

{c:Chorus:}
     It's a[C]mazing[Em], with the [F]blink of an eye you fin[Em]ally see the lig[G]ht
     It's a[C]mazing[Em] when the mo[F]ment arrives that you [Em]know you'll be alrig[G]ht
     It's a[F]mazing[Em] and I'm [D]sayin' a prayer for the des[G]perate hearts tonig[C]ht

That [Am]one last shot's a permanent [D]vacation
And [F]how high can you fly with broken wings?[C]
[Am]Life's a journey not a des[D]tination
And I [F]just can't tell just what tomorrow [G]brings

You have to [Am]learn to crawl before you [G]learn to walk
But I jus[C]t couldn't listen to all that righteous tal[F]k
Well, I was [Fm/G#]out on the street, just [C/G]tryin' to survive
[D/F#]Scratchin' to stay al[F]ive

{c:Chorus}

[D]  Desperate hearts, desperate hearts
[Em]  Did you wanna see without and give it out now (or whatever...)
[F] Ow, oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah, ya ka kow, ya ka ka ka kow

{c:Outro:}
        [C]    [D]    [Em]     [F]      [G]    [Am]     [G]    [F] 
        [C]    [D]    [Em]     [F]      [G]    [Am]     [G]    [F] 

{c:Following is spoken with a 30's newsreel sound}
So from all of us in Aerosmith to all of you out there wherever you are
Remember, the light at the end of the tunnel may be you. Good night.
