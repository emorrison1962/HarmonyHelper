[D] Love wasn't [A] much of a [E] friend of mine
[A] The tables have [E] turned, yeah
[F#m] 'Cause me and those [C#m] ways have parted
[D] That kind of [A] love was the [E] killin' kind
(Listen) [G] All I [D] want is some[G]one I can't [D] resist
[C] I know all I [G] need to know by the [E] way that I got kissed

I was [A] cryin' when I [E] met you

Now there's not even breathin' room [Bb]       [C]         [F]         [G]
Between pleasure and pain [Bb]       [C]         [F]         [G]
Yeah you cry when we're makin' love [Bb]       [C]         [F]         [G]
Must be one and the [Bb] same

It's down on me
Yeah I got to tell you one thing
It's been on my mind
Girl I gotta say
We're partners in crime
You've got that certain something
What you give to me
Takes my breath away
Now the word on the street
Is the devil's in your kiss
If our love goes up in flames
It's a fire I can't resist

I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you
Do what you do to me

'Cause what you got inside
Ain't where your love should stay
Yeah, our love, sweet love, ain't love
'Til you give your heart away

I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' just to let you
Do what you do what you do down to me, baby, baby, baby

I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you
Do what you do down to, down to, down to, down to
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Your love is sweet
I was cryin' when I met you
