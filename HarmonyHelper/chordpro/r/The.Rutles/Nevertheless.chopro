In this day and age, love is all the rage.  
Life goes on, it only goes to show. (Ah-ah-ah) 
It's not my cup of tea.   It's all the same to me.  
For we are here today and gone tomorrow. 
 (We are here today and gone tomorrow) 

Nevertheless, make the most of it, make the most of it.  
Nevertheless, (Ah-ah)   Nevertheless, (Ah-ah)   Nevertheless, (Ah-ah) 
Nevertheless, (Ah-ah-ah,  Ah-ah-ah,  Ah-ah-ah,  Ah-ah-ah,  Ah-ah-ah).
