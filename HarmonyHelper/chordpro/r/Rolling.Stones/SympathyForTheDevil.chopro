Intro:  Bongos, drums, people going 'wooo' and 'yow', etc.

Verse:  [E]Please allow me to intro[D]duce myself, I'm a [A]man of wealth and [E]taste
        I've been around for a long long year, stole many a man's soul and face
        I was round when Jesus Christ had his moments of doubt and pain
        Made damn' sure that Pilate washed his hands and sealed his fate

Chorus: [B]Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my [E]name
        [B]But what's puzzling you is the nature of my [E]game

Verse:  Stuck around St. Petersburg when I saw it was the time for a change
        Killed the Tsar and his ministers, Anastasia screamed in vain
        I rode a tank in the general's rank, when the blitzkrieg raged, 
            and the bodies stank

Chorus:

Verse:  I watched with glee while your kings and queens fought for ten decades
            for the gods they made
        I shouted out 'who killed the Kennedys?' when after all,
            it was you and me
        Let me please introduce myself, I'm a man of wealth and taste
        And I lay traps for troubadours, who get killed before
            they reach Bombay

Chorus:

Solo on verse riff:

Chorus:

Verse:  Just as every cop is a criminal, and all the sinners saints
        This head, this tail, just call me Lucifer, 'cos I'm in need
            of some restraint
        So if you meet me have some courtesy, have some sympathy and some taste
        Use all your well-learned politics, or I'll lay your soul to waste

Chorus:
