{t:What's Good}
{st:Lou Reed}
 
[D]Life's like mayonnaise [G]soda[Em]
[D]And life's like space[Em] without [G]room
[D]And life's like bacon and [G]ice [Em]cream
[D]That's what life's like [Em]without [G]you
 
Life's like forever becoming but
Life's forever dealing in hurt
Now life's like death without livin'
That's what life's like without you
 
Life's like sanskrit to a pony
I see you in my mind's eye stranglin' on your tongue
What good is knowin' such devotion
I been around, huh, I know what makes things run
 
What good is seeing eye chocolate
What good's  a computerized nose
And what good is cancer in April
Why no good, no good at all
 
What good's a war without killing
What good is a rain that falls up
What good's a disease that won't hurt ya
Why no good, no good at all
 
What good are these thoughts that I'm thinkin'
They must be better, huh, not to be thinkin' at all
A styrofoam lover with emotions of concrete
No, not much at all
 
What good is life without livin'
What good is a lion that barks
You've loved a life others throw away nightly
It's not fair at all
 
What's good
Oh, baby what's good
What's good
What's good, not much at all
 
Hey baby what's good
What's good
What's good, what's good
What's good, what's good, not much at all
 
What's good, what's good
What's good, life's good
Life's good, life's good
But not fair at all
