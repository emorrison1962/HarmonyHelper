[C]Well, it's been getting so hard...living with the things you do to me...
[C]My dreams keep getting so strange...I'd like to tell you everything I see...

I'm [C]reaching out for something...touching nothing's all I ever do...
I softly call you over...If you appear there's nothing left of you...

[G]And the man in the back is ready to crack as he raises his hands to the sky...
And the girl in the corner is everyone's moaner...
She'll kill you with the wink of her eye......Oh yeah!...

It's ele[A]ctric...so frightfully [C]hectic...
And the band started [Eb]leaving...and we all stopped [G]breathing...
[G]Yeah...yeah...yeah...yeah...yeah...

And the [A]man in the back said [C]everyone attack and it [D]turned into a...
