The dominant and subdominant chords help define the tonic chord. The dominant chord is one fifth above the tonic and the subdominant chord is one fifth below:

Harmonic Functions : The II and VII Degrees
Let us now take a look at the other degrees. We will start with the II and VII degrees.

The II degree or supertonic has a subdominant function. It can be used as a substitute of the IV degree.

The VII degree or leading tone has a dominant function. It can be used as a substitute of the V degree.

In the next example you can alternate between chords using the buttons and listen to the different harmonizations:

Harmonic Functions : The III and VI Degrees
The III and VI degrees have weak harmonic functions. Yet, they are very useful when harmonizing.

The VI can have both tonic and subdominant functions since it shares two note with both chords. Something similar happens with the III degree that shares notes with both tonic and dominant chords.

In the next table we summarize the discussed chord functions:
